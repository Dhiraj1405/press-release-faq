# OMS API NPM packages

## OMS API NPM packages will help in maintaining abstraction and simplify logics for frontend developers.

OMS API NPM packages help abstract the frontend app developer experience from granular backend APIs, simplifying frontend development. Decoupled integration layers help create standardized data schemas across apps regardless of the server side platform. Abstraction of functions helps frontend developers easily create workflows in apps without relying on their understanding of detailed backend API schemas and details.

Frontend layers that are tightly coupled with backend and API frameworks require a deep understanding of backend logics by any developer trying to maintain them, creating a significant learning curve before development. All apps also have to keep up with server side changes, which leads to a lot of repetitive work and may result in errors.

Decoupling frontend layers from backend and API frameworks and standardized functions and schemas, results in easier maintenance and a shorter developer learning curve. As server side changes and updates arise, simply updating the relevant OMS package means all dependent apps are compatible without needing to update their internal code, dramatically reducing the maintenance effort of managing multiple specialized interfaces.

Frontend developers may now import “OMS API NPM packages” into the apps.
