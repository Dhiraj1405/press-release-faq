# Financial Auditing

## Merchants need an automated auditing tool to ensure sales, returns and assessments are synchronized across all systems.

Financial auditing allows merchants to reconcile sales, returns and appeasement from their eCommerce, OMS and ERP. Merchants will be able to effortlessly find gaps and identify any missing line items through scheduled daily or monthly itemized reports for integrated systems.

Pinpointing the causes of any discrepancy is extremely difficult for merchants when overall monthly sales, returns or appeasement figures in ERP, OMS, and eCommerce do not match. Manually identifying discrepancies is tedious and often inaccurate. After finding gaps, filling variances between systems for a large number of records can take an extended period of time for auditors. Additionally, when these processes are manual, their frequency is much lower, often once a month or quarter.

The financial auditing tool will independently sync and cross-analyze data across merchantâ€™s eCommerce, OMS and ERP. The platform will audit system integrations connected with the OMS and monitor data integrity by ensuring no sales and returns data is lost or misrepresented. Additionally, if any kind of disparity is reported, the tool will scrutinize the entire set of data and disseminate the exact cause of variation, therefore, allowing merchants to easily troubleshoot the issue.

If a merchant has a third-party ERP system that does not have a pre-built integration with HotWax, then an integration between the financial auditing platform and ERP will be developed. The ideal auditing schedule for merchants may be daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly as per their preferences. The selected timeframe will serve as the basis for the auditing process.
