# BOPIS Push Notifications 

## Instant order notifications make sure all orders are packed and ready on time for customer pick-up.

BOPIS push notifications alert store associates when new orders are received and send reminders for pending orders that require attention. Real-time updates ensure that store fulfillment teams prepare BOPIS orders as quickly as possible. Fulfilling BOPIS orders as per the schedule supports efficient customer service and elevates customer satisfaction.

Customers want to pick up BOPIS orders the same day, usually within hours of placing it. If store associates don’t check their BOPIS app, it creates delays in the order processing and high cancellation rates. The longer a BOPIS order remains unfulfilled, customer complaints to support reps go up, and increases the likelihood of walk-in customers buying the reserved inventory before its set aside for the BOPIS customer, resulting in poor customer experience.

Push notifications keep store associates aware of BOPIS orders as soon as they are captured and make sure orders are timely prepared. Store fulfillment teams will also receive reminder notifications for pending orders to stay aligned with fulfillment schedules. Systemized updates to store associates for BOPIS orders helps in managing customer expectations.

Users using HotWax Commerce BOPIS fulfillment app will receive instant push notifications for new orders and reminders for pending orders.
