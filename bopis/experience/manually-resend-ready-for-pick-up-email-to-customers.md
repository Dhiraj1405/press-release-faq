# Manually resend ready for pick-up email to customers

## Store associates using the BOPIS Fulfillment App must have an option to re-send pick-up mails to customers.

Emails with pick-up schedules are automatically triggered to customers when store fulfillment teams mark orders as “ready for pick-up”. Resending pick-up emails for BOPIS orders lets store staff remind customers of their pick-up orders in the event that they miss the first ready for pick-up email sent to them.

Since the “ready for pick-up” email is only sent once, they are often overlooked by customers creating delays in fulfillment, miscommunication and even order cancellations from customers. Calling customers to find out why they haven't collected their BOPIS orders is time-consuming and adds to CSRs' workload. Many customers then also choose to cancel their orders since they expected same day pick-up for BOPIS orders, and delayed fulfillment may no longer serve their purpose.

Store fulfillment teams can easily monitor pending packed BOPIS orders and quickly resend pick-up reminder emails to customers, right from the fulfillment app. The ability to resend “ready for pick-up’’ emails will  keep customers informed about their store pick-up orders. Accurately updating customers with the fulfillment schedules will also help in managing customers expectations.
