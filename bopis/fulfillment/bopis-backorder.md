# BOPIS backorder 

## Retailers should be able to take BOPIS orders for their out of stock products.

HotWax’s “BOPIS backorder” feature lets retailers capture BOPIS orders for out-of-stock products. All such BOPIS backorders are held in the store pick-up backorder parking and can be released for fulfillment and pick-up when their inventory arrives.

Products offered for pick-up may run out-of-stock before their planned future inventory arrives. Inability to accept BOPIS orders on the future inventory results in lost sales and reduced profit margins. Not displaying a product’s future availability also leads to unpredictable BOPIS experience. 

HotWax will display a “Pick-up when in stock” button and estimated pick-up date for products that can be picked-up but are currently not in stock. Once these products are restocked, they can be released for fulfillment and picked-up by customers based on their scheduled pick-up timelines. The ability to take orders on out-of-stock products also helps retailers to secure sales and ensure increased revenues.

Retailers using HotWax Commerce’s Backorder and BOPIS solutions may now implement the “BOPIS backorder” feature by customizing their PDP BOPIS experience to also factor backorder product availability.

### FAQs

**Question 1: How will HotWax identify if out-of-stock products are eligible for pick-up and make them available for backorder?** 

Answer: When offering BOPIS, if a product has no inventory and has a backorder tag in Shopify, HotWax will display the "Pick-up when in stock" button on the PDP and allow customers to place BOPIS backorders.

**Question 2: How will HotWax inform customers about their pick-up schedules?**

Answer: Once a pick-up order is ready and packed, store associates can mark the order as “ready for pick-up”. HotWax then triggers an email to the customers with their store pick-up schedules.

**Question 3: Is it possible to allow BOPIS backorder only at a few facilities?**

Answer: Yes, retailers with multiple facilities can configure for which stores they want to allow BOPIS orders. If a retailer’s certain facilities do not allow the store pick-up option, then the out-of-stock products at those locations will not be eligible for BOPIS backorders.

### Internal FAQs

**Question 1: How will HotWax broker BOPIS backorder items?**

Answer: Brokering algorithm for BOPIS backorders is still under development for multiple facilities.

**Question 2: Do BOPIS backorders go to the standard backorder parking?**

Answer: No, all BOPIS backorders go to "store pick-up backorder parking". If BOPIS backorders go to the standard backorder parking, the "store pick-up" shipping method will be applied on all order items of a ship group, including "ship to home" items. Therefore, to ensure that the correct shipping method is added on order items, HotWax holds all BOPIS backorders in the "store pick-up backorder parking".
