# Configurable routing

## Merchants want to independently set up multiple routing rules for brokering orders based on dynamic business requirements.

Merchants use configurable routing to create order fulfillment strategies best suited for their business. User configurable routing rules allows merchants to optimize fulfillment cost, inventory, and workload based on arbitrary order and fulfillment location parameters such as order total, SKUs, product category, or facility type, operating hours, or fulfillment capacity.

Hard-coded routing order brokering rules with confined attributes makes it difficult and time consuming to implement changes dynamically. Distinct objectives and priorities based on retailer specific needs mean that out-of-the-box routing rules don't align with every environment, resulting in higher operational costs and inefficient last-mile delivery. Merchants also usually have unique fulfillment strategies for different seasons, often aligned with calendar seasonality, and inability to continuously update their brokering workflow could lead to reduced fulfillment throughput.

Configurable routing brokers a set of orders to fulfill from a set of facilities. A brokering algorithm can have multiple, sequential, rule-sets with unique attributes and conditions which orders and facilities will be evaluated against. For unfillable orders that did not meet routing criterias under any rule-set, merchants can explicitly state what actions must be taken. Deep customization of brokering workflow will allow merchants to implement real-time revisions to their routing parameters without any external support.

Merchants using HotWax Commerce can create their set of order routing rules, schedule flow of brokering sequence, customize routing logics and outcomes using the Brokerking Rules Configure App or may also use predefined rules set by HotWax Commerce.
