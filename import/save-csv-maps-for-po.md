# Save CSV maps for POs

## When uploading purchase orders in the Import App, merchandisers would like to auto-save their frequently used PO CSV maps. 

Saving PO CSV formats lets users upload purchase orders quickly, without the added effort of mapping each PO field to fields in the Import App each time. Merchandisers can add and save their custom PO layouts, or they may use the pre-loaded PO CSV maps that HotWax Commerce provides by default. 

Merchandisers are required to map their existing purchase order fields according to the format set by the app for uploading POs every time. Remapping the same PO formats over and over again is tedious especially for merchandisers handling several purchase orders on a daily basis. If a company has multiple teams managing purchase orders, training users how to map PO fields in the Import App can also take an extended period of time while also introducing discrepancies from mismatched fields.

Merchandisers will be able to auto-save their PO CSV maps right into the app. Custom mappings will be saved at the company level to ensure everyone has access to the same templates. Additionally, the app will also include pre-loaded CSV maps from commonly used ERP systems like NetSuite and ORSI. Users can select a readily available PO CSV format or may create and save their unique mappings to upload purchase orders.

Merchandisers will automatically receive the feature to save their preferable CSV mappings in the Import App or they may also use pre-loaded formats present in the app.
