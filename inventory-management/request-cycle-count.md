# Request cycle count

## Merchants want to be able notify store staff for cycle counts as and when needed.

The request cycle count functionality will allow merchants to instantly update store staff to reconcile inventory. In case when CSRs need to find inventory for fulfillment, requesting cycle counts will facilitate prompt communication and action. Store staff can access the item-by-item list and feed the inventory quantities present in a facility via the cycle count app. Store managers and other stakeholders can use these counts to identify problematic variances.

Managing cycle counts requires a lot of manual communication, especially for merchants with a large inventory network. Operations managers, like store managers, often aren’t in a position to directly communicate cycle count requests to ground teams, instead rely on static forms of communication like email. If merchants need inventory reconciliation for multiple items, inconsistency in the information flow leads to delayed fulfillment due to lack of systemic inventory.

Staff managing cycle counts will receive real time push notifications when a cycle count is assigned to them. Entire list of items that must be counted or recounted will be visible in the cycle count app, keeping everyone in the operation up to date with upcoming tasks. The ability to track a dynamic list of items that need reconciliation leaves no room for ambiguity. Systematic workflow will also allow merchants to respond quickly to inventory discrepancies and take corrective measures if any inventory inaccuracy is identified.

Merchants will automatically receive the feature to reconcile inventory counts. They can request cycle counts from the product inventory page by selecting a facility where they want to re-count inventory. 

### Testimony

*Internal quote*: HotWax clients can now request inventory counts at the facilities as and when required.

*Customer quote*: We need to frequently request cycle counts for products at our stores. Cycle counting capability / inventory updates in your tool are super important to me as part of launch. How long would that take to develop?
As a store employee:

- I will logon to HotWax application and select Cycle Count with my individual ID (krewe email + password)
