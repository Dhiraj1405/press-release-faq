# Advanced job parameters

## The Job Manager App must allow users to pass their valid special parameters that are not available by default.

Advanced job parameters lets users pass their custom parameters in the job run time data from the Job Manager App. Certain business operations require executing specialized parameters and workflows. The ability to independently configure jobs and services allows users to leverage special configuration for their business. 

Users managing jobs from the Job Manager App only have the ability to control basic job functionalities like frequency, run-time and statuses of pre-configured jobs. Not allowing optional parameters when running a service increases difficulty when managing business edge cases, increasing dependency on HotWax support.

Users aware of the special parameters will be able to pass them in the job run time data to meet their unique business needs. Added flexibility to input certain specific job data will allow users to customize job attributes without any external support. Defining specialized parameters for running a service will also help users personalize jobs to their specific needs.

Merchants using the Job Manager App will already receive the feature to add optional parameters in their job run time data. Users will need to feed the specific keys and expected values required in the job dataset to run a service optimized for their need.
