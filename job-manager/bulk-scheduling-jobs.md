# Bulk scheduling jobs

## Merchants operating a product store with multiple Shopify configs want to be able to schedule their standard jobs for all the connected eCommerce stores at once.

Bulk scheduling jobs allows selecting multiple jobs for many Shopify eCommerce stores at the same time. Users may configure jobs, choose each jobâ€™s run time and frequency based on their business needs.

Implementing an initial set-up for a process or configuring an operation across many Shopify stores requires independently scheduling jobs for each store. Users could only select a single Shopify config for which they want to manage jobs. Back and forth performing the same sequence of operations to schedule identical jobs across multiple Shopify stores is straining and increases the chances of errors. Accidentally failing to schedule a job for a store results in integrated systems to run out of sync. Unaware users then end-up spending hours identifying the source of discrepancies and require special assistance in order to make corrective actions.

Bulk scheduling jobs will let users collectively manage multiple jobs across all Shopify eCommerce stores. Users may select all the jobs they want to configure, the stores they want and schedule them all at once. The ability to select and schedule multiple jobs together ensures streamlined and synchronized workflows across all Shopify stores.

Merchants using HotWax Commerce already have access to the Job Manager App. To bulk schedule jobs, merchants will need to go to the Job Manager App, select product store and its associated Shopify configs, select their preferable jobs, run time and operating frequency.
