# Miscellaneous Jobs in Job Manager

## Some merchants have unique automations and processes that they’d like to manage from the Job Manager app.

The Miscellaneous Jobs catalog allows merchants to manage and control their unique jobs that are not available out of the box. Merchants will be able to add and run their purpose-built jobs in the Job Manager app using Miscellaneous Jobs.

Merchants may have special automations and integrations they want to manage, however the Job Manager doesn’t accommodate client specific custom jobs and workflows. Additionally, certain task oriented jobs specific to a merchant’s ecosystem may not serve utility for other merchants so they shouldn’t be available to everyone out of the box. Inability to accommodate a merchant’s jobs creates inconvenience in their day-to-day operations and requires increased assistance from HotWax Support and developer personnel to manage those jobs for them.

The ability to list Miscellaneous Jobs will let merchants incorporate every job, significant to their core functioning, right into the app. In addition to managing predefined jobs, merchants will be able to schedule, skip, or cancel their custom jobs through Job Manager. They will also be able to recategorize their custom jobs as they see fit for easier management. Added flexibility of miscellaneous custom jobs ensures that merchants can use HotWax Commerce to fit their exact business needs.

Merchants using HotWax Commerce already have access to the Job Manager app, new Miscellaneous Jobs have to be added by an account executive, after which, merchants will have access to those jobs whenever they need. Merchants will be able edit a job’s classification by changing its type, doing so they can recategorize jobs to their preferred section in the Job Manager app.
