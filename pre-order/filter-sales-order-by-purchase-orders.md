# Filter sales order by purchase orders

## Merchants want to be able quickly identify all the sales orders received against a purchase orderâ€™s inventory when reconciling their pre-orders.

Merchants usually use purchase orders for accepting pre-orders. The link attached on the purchase order view page will allow merchants to readily audit consumed PO inventory and its associated sales orders. Merchants can easily look-up if there are any deviations between the promisable PO inventory and recorded pre-orders.

Tracking sales orders received for a particular PO gets extremely challenging when merchants want to ensure that PO allocations have been accurately made. Merchants need to map sales orders using the arrival date of a PO and then click into each sales order to validate its corresponding purchase order. If the arrival date of the on order inventory is changed, it adds up further complexities in identifying the associated sales orders.

Merchants can easily review if the on order inventory allocations have been made correctly by checking the list of all sales orders received for a particular PO item. Easily filtering out the associated sales orders will also allow merchants to quickly pinpoint if there is a mismatch in ATP and recorded sales orders.

Merchants using HotWax Commerce will already receive the feature to filter sales orders by purchase orders. Merchants will need to go to the purchase order find page, select the purchase order for which they want to check the received sales orders and click on the link to view all associated sales orders.
