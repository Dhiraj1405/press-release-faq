# Initiate and receive returns 
 
## Retailers want to be able to accept and quickly process in-store returns for online orders.

HotWax OMS provides an order look-up and RMA screen where store associates can search a customer’s order using Shopify’s order ID, select order items to be returned and their return type, defining which payment method is being credited. If a customer requests a refund to their original payment method, the PushReturnfromHotWax service pushes the order return in Shopify and an instant refund is triggered to the customer’s source account. On requesting a store credit, the service processes a return without a refund to Shopify, and the customer receives the store credit via POS.

Accepting in-store returns for online orders is not possible for retailers who do not use Shopify POS since their POS does not keep track of online sales. Customers who wish to return an item must prepare a return shipment and then ship it to the retailer. The entire return process is inconvenient for customers and also delays their refunds.

HotWax Commerce's RMA screen lets store associates directly initiate and receive in-store returns for online orders. Retailers can quickly process in-store returns and automate refunds, which otherwise takes a lot of time. For all returns created in HotWax, the service PushReturnfromHotWax will sync back return and refund information to Shopify and POS, allowing customers to receive instant refunds based on the return type. In-store returns also open up an opportunity for retailers to leverage exchanges and save the sale when customers come to the store for returning their online orders.

Store associates can access the RMA screen and search the customer’s order using Shopify’s Order ID, select the item from the particular order to be returned and select the type of return to process the returns.

### FAQs

**Question 1: Can store reps access all screens or just the returns screen?**

Answer: Store Managers and reps can only access the RMA screen in the OMS.

**Question 2: What would be workflows around exchanges?**

Answer: Customers returning their online sales orders in-store may avail store credit against their return item. The store credit can be then used to purchase another item in exchange. 

### Internal FAQs

**Question 1: What would the scenario around returns be if a merchant is using Shopify POS?**

Answer: Since the Shopify POS will also have all the records of online orders, store associates may then directly accept and process in-store returns by selecting which order item is being returned.

**Question 2: How would HotWax handle returns when Shopify is the inventory master?**

Answer: HotWax's RMA screen will be used by store associates to accept in-store returns for online orders. HotWax will push returns and refunds information to Shopify. If Shopify is the inventory master, HotWax will read and sync inventory counts of returned products from Shopify.
